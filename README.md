# Project 1: Kids' Bookclub

A three page website to encourage parents or guardians of children age 4-12 years old to sign up their children for Kids' Bookclubs in Ireland. The content is aimed to appeal to users - mostly parents or guardians of children age 4-12 years old, and the children themselves. A home page gives a basic idea of the bookclubs, and includes location and meetup times. A gallery page shows images of what the bookclubs are like. A Join Up page allows parents or guardians to sign their children up to a group. It also includes contact information, a map and a link to a Youtube video. Each page has a footer with a link to the bookclubs' social media pages. 

The live site can be found here: https://rozwelch.github.io/kids-bookclub1/index.html

## Features 

I aimed to provide a clear, easy to understand and easy to navigate website that would appeal to both parents/guardians, and also to children ages 4-12 years.

- Navigation 

  - The fully responsive navigation is on all three pages, it includes links to the Home page, Gallery and Join Up page and is identical in each page to allow for easy navigation.
  - It is positioned to be easy to view, and styled to be easy to read.
  - This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button. 
  - The main Kids' Bookclub logo also links to the home page.

  UX:  A First Time user will want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.

## Testing 

The website was tested on Chrome and Safari browers.
The website was tested on desktop, laptop, tablet and mobile size screens (Devices tested on: iPhone 11 and 12, Samsung Galaxy S22, iPad, iMac pro 15in screen, iMac 27in screen).
The links were tested on the deployed site, and the form was tested. 
All images were resized and saved for web using Adobe Photoshop, which ensured they were compressed for best file size.

Full testing steps:
